=GAME=

The program simulates a game of tic-tac-toe between to computer players.
Both players are a process that wait for their turns before placing a mark on
the board. The decision is done randomly and the game ends whenever a
normal tic-tac-toe game would end.

=RACE=

The first argument is the number of horses, while the second argument is the
distance of the finish line. 

The program simulates a horse race using multiple processes.

Each horse process sleeps for a random amount of seconds before stepping
forward, and the race ends when all horses reach the end of the finish line.
