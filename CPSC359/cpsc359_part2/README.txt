The resolution used for the program was 1024 x 768 as stated was allowed in a previous email
				
Some code was borrowed from tutorial examples, as well as the make file. Modifications were
made as necessary, and game play as well as game logic are all original. Controller code was
taken from our previous project part 1, and is thus also original. The drawings were kept 
simple, and are strictly meant to represent objects moving.

The gimp files were included for user to view, if they want to.

The time to compile may be a bit long due to the size of these files used, as well as the
implementation. just running the make file should be enough to compile the program and no
further action needs to be done (besides attactching a controller to the RPi).
